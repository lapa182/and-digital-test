# And-Digital Test
- Used Angular-CLI to generate the project, as well the providers/components;
- Used Bulma CSS Framework for quick prototype;
- Angular-CLI provided all the test tools and commands;
- Used AngularJS 4.x and Typescript
- To generate the json style, I've used [Ngx Json View](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-json-view)

## Development server

First of all `npm install`.

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. Dist folder contains the build.

For testing purposes, I've added the dist folder to the repository, but normally I wouldn't do that.

## Deployment tool

Using firebase for hosting, you can run `npm run deploy`, which will build and deploy using firebase. Small note, probably you guys won't have access for it, but if you guys provide me one e-mail, I can add to the project so can see it working, but here's the link example of the hosting: [AndDigitalTest](https://anddigital-test.firebaseapp.com)

# Reasons choosing AngularJS

I chose AngularJS 4 because I saw an opportunity to me to improve my knowledge. I didn't have projects before that could use Angular, so I preferred to give it a try and see how it goes. Compared with 1.x, it's far different coding with Typescript and with the integration in VSCode it's amazing the imports of the modules, saving us sometime.
