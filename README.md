# And-Digital Test
- Used Angular-CLI to generate the project, as well the providers/components;
- Used Bulma CSS Framework for quick prototype;
- Angular-CLI provided all the test tools and commands;
- Used AngularJS 4.x and Typescript
- To generate the json style, I've used [Ngx Json View](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-json-view)

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. Dist folder contains the build.

# Reasons choosing AngularJS

I chose AngularJS 4 because I saw an opportunity to me to improve my knowledge. I didn't have projects before that could use Angular, so I preferred to give it a try and see how it goes. Compared with 1.x, it's far different coding with Typescript and with the integration in VSCode it's amazing the imports of the modules, saving us sometime.
